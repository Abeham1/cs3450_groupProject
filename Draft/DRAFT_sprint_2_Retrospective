what went well?
list successful user stories
	abe's work was truest to the high level concept
	other use cases are more of a "version 1"
	menu mod functions seem pretty ok
	pair programming is still working really well, probably wouldn't have finished sprint without teamwork
	
	We merged to master at regular intervals when all team members were present
	We branched b4 moving forward

what did not go well
	Django is really hard
		lots of lost time trying things that didn't work
		technical problems implementing design descisions

	People unable to work during Easter holiday
	People got sick
		-- relate to actual workplaces
	
	.tk revoked my namespace and had to switch to chaosreader.ddns.net
		-- TOS violation (no running website at domain name)


How should you improve
	We are going to work together in the iis lab more
		-- invite Aaron and Abe 2
	More code comments
	Schedule demo days in the next sprint (show us how your code works!)
