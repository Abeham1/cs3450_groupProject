## Problem Statement

Running a restaurant involves keeping track of lots of little details and keeping many people informed about ever changing customer requests.
Our software package will help manage the complexity of running a restaurant by taking care of order management, order communication, and order tracking while providing management real time insights into their workflow. One key element of differentiation is that we plan to incorporate customer feedback into the managerial views as wells as for customers while they decide what to order.
Generally, we are trying to solve the following issues: customer satisfaction, inventory control, possible staff reduction, order entry, order tracking, restaurant startup cost reduction, electronic ticketing system.
